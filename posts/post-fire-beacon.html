            When I started writing this blog, it encourages me to get outside to explore my local area a lot more. Lots
            of walks, cheeky pub stops and lovely café cakes certainly don’t hurt! This got me and Katie out of the
            house a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I didn’t expect from this is how many people we would meet by writing this blog and whilst out and
            about. There are many passionate Devonians near by who love to share their walking experiences and give tips
            and guides on where to visit next.
          </p>

            Fire Beacon Hill is an area of lowland heath, which offers you a birds eye view of the surrounding
            countryside. On a good day you can almost see from Berry Head to Portland, the entire length of Lyme Bay.
          </p>

          <p>
            The view at Fire Beacon Hill did not disappoint, even though it wasn’t the clearest of days here was a
            sweeping view of the Jurassic Coast.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the top of the hill it was a mixture of lowland heath and woods with windy paths crossing eachother. We
            had a good walk around and we will definitely go back to explore more. It’s lovely place for bird watching,
            and just anyone who loves a good view and some nature.
          </p>

          <p>
            As someone who dabbles in geocaching it was good to see there is a route here for you too if you are
            interested in following a few riddles. There is plenty of space to stretch the little ones and the dogs
            legs.
          </p>

          <p>
            We stopped for a quick picnic though if you would prefer your food prepared for you The Bowd inn is nearby
            who serve a mean sandwich.
          </p>

          <p>
            The walk took about an hour or so with quite a few photo stops in the mix. If you want an easier walk or an
            extension to this one then head for Harpford Woods – the walk takes you through the woods to the village of
            Harpford, over the River Otter and close to Newton Poppleford.

            As its name suggests, Fire Beacon Hill was the site of one of the beacons used to inform Elizabethan London
            of the approaching Spanish Armada. At that time the entire East Hill escarpment would have been covered in
            lowland heath vegetation, similar to that found here. Unfortunately, just this small patch remains, as
            lowland heath has disappeared due to forestry plantation and agricultural improvement, making this habitat
            increasingly uncommon...
