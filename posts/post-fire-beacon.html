            When I started this blog I knew that it would encourage me to get
            out and explore my local area. Walks, cream teas, local
            attractions and even a bit of shopping. New things I could do with
            my family. I am surprised that I am always finding out about
            different places and that keeps me wanting to discover more.
          </p>

            Writing a blog is a lot more involved that I ever imagined, there
            are so many elements to it that I had not really given much
            thought to. I did do some research before starting it but couldn’t
            really find anyone else doing the same thing locally, so off I
            went. A year on it turns out I am far from alone! Devon is full of
            bloggers – some write about their children and the challenges of
            parenting, others about food, home decor, holidays, fashion or
            like me about the area they live in.

            What I did not expect from blogging was to make new friends. We
            chat mainly online over the trials and tribulations of blogging,
            sharing what we are passionate about, supporting each other in all
            manner of ways. However these are not just virtual social media
            friends, they’re proper, flesh and blood ones too!

            One thing East Devon certainly has in abundance is views. Fire
            Beacon Hill did not disappoint. Our day wasn’t the clearest but
            there was a sweeping view of Lyme Bay and the Jurassic Coast.
            There is a trig point height of 224 meters.
          </p>

          <p>
            The top was a mixture of heath land and woods with paths
            criss-crossing. We explored a bit and I will go back with my own
            tribe to see more. A great spot for bird watchers and nature
            lovers.
          </p>

            If you are a fan of Geo caching then there is a route here for you
            too. There’s lots of space for running around (dogs and children)!
            It would be a great spot for a small picnic if you felt like
            carrying one! Or you can do what we did and head back to The Bowd
            Inn for a sandwich!
          </p>

          <p>
            So thank you to my new walking friend, her little boy and the dog for sharing this walk with me.
          </p>

            Our walk, which included lots of photo stops, took about an hour.
            If you want an easier walk or an extension to this one then head
            for Harpford Woods – the East Devon Way takes you through the
            woods to the village of Harpford, over the River Otter and close
            to Newton Poppleford. There is also an option to park nearer the
            top of the hill if you follow the directions on the East Devon
            Countryside web page.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would certainly recommend the route we took and 2 minute drive
            back for a pub lunch at The Bowd Inn was ideal. There is a
            children’s play area, benches outside and it is dog friendly so
            was a great way to end our morning out.

            As its name suggests, Fire Beacon Hill was the site of one of the beacons used to inform Elizabethan London
            of the approaching Spanish Armada. At that time the entire East Hill escarpment would have been covered in
            lowland heath vegetation, similar to that found here. Unfortunately, just this small patch remains, as
            lowland heath has disappeared due to forestry plantation and agricultural improvement, making this habitat
            increasingly uncommon...
